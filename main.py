Fancy task managers with slick user interfaces are slow and cumbersome.
Now that you have the power of the command line at your disposal, you
would like be able to access all your tasks without having to burden
yourself with tedious pointing and clicking. For your final project,
you will design an object oriented task manager application that will
allow you to enter tasks, save them to a file, and retrieve them...all
without moving your hands from the keyboard.
